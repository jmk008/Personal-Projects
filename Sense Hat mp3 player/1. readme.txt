A sensehat, raspi app to play mp3 from raspi using sense hat.

The app changes tracks and alters volume using joystick controls. New songs need to be imported and added to the scratch script.
Allows random design creation on the sense hat during when the song is being played.

Future Scope: Integrate Napster/Spotify/Google Assistant services into the player.

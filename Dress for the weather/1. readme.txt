Instructions:

1. Navigate to OpenWeatherMap to sign up for a free account

2. Once signed in, you can see your API key on the dashboard

3. The OpenWeatherMap API requires you to use a city ID to identify the different cities all around the world. 
They provide a list of city IDs. Download the file and place it in the same directory as your code. (File already present)

4. Don’t try and open the file; it’s really big, and could crash your computer.(Once unzipped)

5. Wirte the python program as in 'weather.py'

6. The result is quite a big dictionary and very confusing to look at.
 Fortunately, pprint will help make more sense of the data.

To execute:
1. Execute the 'weather.py' file

2. Extract the city.list.gz file before execution
